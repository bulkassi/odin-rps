# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is implemented using very basic Javascript, including variables, conditionals and function basics. No styling to the page is applied given the project's [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-variables-and-operators#assignment).
